- fn + Shift + F10 runs function

- function(sub routine) declaration: returnType name(parameters);

- function has to be declared physically before it is used:
	void sayHello();
	int main() {
		sayHello();
	}
- array indexes like java, but will not error index out of bounds if a variable is called arguement: b = 6; a[6]; -> no error until runtime.

- understand Passing Arrays slide!!! - test
	changing what 'a' points to doesn't stick
	changing what is in 'a' sticks

- understand Buble Sort: j = 1?
